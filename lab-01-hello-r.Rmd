## Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(datasauRus)
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

1846 rows and 3 variables/columns

### Exercise 2

```{r plot-dino, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
dino_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "dino")

ggplot(data = dino_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r cor-dino}
dino_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

### Exercise 3

```{r plot-star}
star_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "star")

ggplot(data = star_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

Meaningful text: this is cool. I got this on my first go...yaya!

```{r cor-star}
star_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

The correlation of the star data is very similar to the dino data.

### Exercise 4

```{r plot-circle}
circle_data <- datasaurus_dozen %>%
  filter(dataset == "circle")

ggplot(data = circle_data, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r cor-circle}
circle_data %>%
  summarize(r = cor(x, y))
```

The correlation is slightly larger than dino, but smaller than star. 

### Exercise 5

Add code and narrative as needed.

To add R chunks either type out the backticks, curly braces, and the letter `r` or use the Insert chunk button above, green C+.



## Bonus Tips by Yoo Ri

Here are some helpful tips :) 

* filter() is for extracting rows

* group_by() is for grouping datasets by assigned column 
* ungroup() cancels the grouping 

* summarize()  is often used with group_by(). This function can print the output according to the group_by().

* facet_grid(y~x,...) creates a grid with variable y as a row, variable x as a column  
* facet_wrap(x,... ) is useful when there is only one variable
